The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\n\nCurrent environment\n\n-\n\nEnvironment\n\n-\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\n\nData\n\n-\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\n\nWeb API\n\n-\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n-\n\nCustom connector\n\n-\n\n\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess\n\n-\n\n\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n-\n\n\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\nYou need to configure a Dataverse trigger and action in a Power Automate flow so researchers can update account records with data from the Web API even if they do not have edit privileges on the record.\n\n\n\nWhat should you configure for each trigger and action requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.",

The company subsidizes home improvements for domestic customers, to improve energy efficiency and to meet environmental commitments. The company also distributes and generates electricity for domestic and commercial customers. The company has 2,000 employees in multiple offices and in work-from-home locations.\n\nCity Power & Light uses a team of schedulers, assessors, field engineers, and customer support agents for home improvements in a program named Get Energy Fit.\n\n\nCurrent Environment\n-\n\n\nGet Energy Fit Program\n-\nCity Power & Light uses the following to manage the Get Energy Fit program:\n\n• The company uses a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet named Planning Hub on Microsoft SharePoint Online to store information about customer appointments, customer details, and customer eligibility in the program.\n• The company records sensitive customer information that includes the document identification numbers and the customer's financial information.\n• The company uses an assessor to verify customer eligibility in the program and to perform a suitability assessment. The assessor completes the suitability assessment by using a paper and clipboard at the customer property and enters the data to the Planning Hub after the assessment is completed. The assessor also uploads photographs to an on-premises document library. The assessor completes the eligibility assessment by using an application written in React.\n• Schedulers use Microsoft Outlook to schedule engineers and assessors for home improvement appointments. About 200 appointments are scheduled daily.\n• Employees for the company submit funding claims on behalf of the customer by uploading evidence and compliance checks information to an application named the Claim Submission Portal.\n\n\nTechnical Environment\n-\n• Schedulers use Windows 11 desktop and laptop computers with the latest version of Microsoft Edge.\n• Assessors use iOS and Android tablet devices.\n• The Claim Submission Portal uses REST-based APIs for all operations and a dedicated testing environment. Authentication to the API is provided by using the following example header key and value pair:\n  o Authentication: 2C8D41431415E429C7FC7A74D8315\n• The company uses Microsoft Azure for hosting multiple applications.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\nOverview\n-\nCity Power & Light plans to implement Microsoft Power Platform to improve the customer experience and increase delivery for the Get Energy Fit program.\n\n\nBusiness Requirements\n-\n• Only team leaders and senior managers should have access to read personally identifiable information (PII).\n• All development changes must be tested in a separate environment.\n• The company requires out-of-the-box solutions, when possible.\n• Sensitive credentials, such as user passwords and API secrets, must be stored securely.\n• The Claim Submission Portal must allow citizen developers to create automated solutions.\n• Customer and appointment information must be accessible to all applications.\n\n\nPlanning Hub Application\n-\nThe company is planning to replace the Planning Hub spreadsheet with a new application. The new application has the following requirements:\n\n• The application must support a component design that provides rapid changes requested by the schedulers.\n• The data model for the application must capture the following information:\n\n  o Information about customers such as name, address, and other PII.\n  o The data and time for an assessor's or engineer's appointment. Schedulers must be able to view all appointments without filters.\n  o Records the details of the home improvements installed for the customer.\n  o Contains all the information and evidence for submission to the Claim Submission Portal.\n\n• After an assessor uploads the funding application and all evidence after a home improvement has been complete, the company requires that the status of the application is set to Submit and should run the following:\n\n  o Retrieve the details about the customer and the improvement installed.\n  o Send an approval to a senior manager to review and approve in Microsoft Teams.\n  o Upload the information to the API endpoint.\n  o If the upload fails to complete, it should retry after a delay of 30 seconds up to three times. If an error occurs after three times, the application should send an email notification to the application support team.\n  o Must record the status on the funding application.\n\n\nSuitability Assessment Tool\n-\nThe company plans to implement a new application named the Suitability Assessment Tool for the assessors. The new application has the following requirements:\n\n• Must integrate with Microsoft Power Platform.\n• Assessors must be able to complete the eligibility assessment by using the Suitability Assessment Tool. The assessors must be able to upload photographs to the on-premises file share.\n• Must be developed by using modular components that can be used by other applications.\n• Must be optimized for use on tablet devices.\n• All changes to the application must be completed in the Suitability Assessment Tool solution.\n\n\nReporting\n-\nThe company has the following requirements for a reporting solution:\n\n• The data source for the reporting solution must support incremental refreshes.\n• The solution must report accurate data if an error occurs.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n• A recent audit identified that all users can access the PII in the Planning Hub spreadsheet.\n• After a developer deploys a change to the production environment, a user reports information is loaded incorrectly to the test system when processing a funding application.\n• After deploying a change to the new eligibility assessment tool in the development environment, you observe that the changes do not appear in the development environment.\n• After removing a column from the Planning Hub application and deploying the changes to the production environment, you observe that the column is still present.\n• You deploy the customizations for the data model. Users report that the email address of the user who created the appointment is missing and that searches on the description information do not return any results.\n\nYou need to build the automation for the Planning Hub application.\n\n \n\nWhich connector should you use? To answer, move the appropriate connectors to the correct requirements. You may use each connector once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to move the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.",
