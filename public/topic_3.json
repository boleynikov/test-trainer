When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\\n\\n\\nBackground\\n-\\n\\nProseware, Inc. is an industry leading software company with several thousand employees. The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\\n\\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\\n\\n\\nCurrent Environment\\n-\\n\\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\\n\\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\\n\\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\\n\\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\\n\\n• JobPosting\\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\\n- Contact identifier\\n- First name\\n- Last name\\n- Time-Zone Offset\\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\\n• Application proapplication\\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\\n• Interview\\n- Application - lookup to Application\\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\\n• Referral\\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\\n• SystemUser\\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\\n- Time-Zone Offset\\n• Recruiter\\n- Recruiter identifier\\n- Recruiter name\\n\\n\\nApplications\\n-\\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.\\n\\n\\nInterviews\\n-\\nEach interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.\\n\\nThe interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.\\n\\nRequirements. Interview Scheduling\\n\\nThe system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.\\n\\n• The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.\\n• The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.\\n• You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.\\n\\nYou must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate’s local time.\\n\\nRequirements. Historical Information Tracking\\n\\nYou must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.\\n\\n• You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:\\n  - The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations\\n  - The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years\\n  - Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant\\n• Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.\\n• The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.\\n\\nRequirements. Historical Information Scoring\\n\\nThe automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.\\n\\n• This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.\\n• A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:\\n  - Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.\\n  - Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.\\n  - Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.\\n  - Each designation or certification adds one to the score.\\n• All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur. You must assign the score to the Person of interest field.\\n• Values representing totals or scores must be stored in their own numeric fields.\\n• Plug-ins must be used to keep the Person of Interest field on active interview records associated with the Contact.\\n• Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest. Recruiters must receive the message when the field is updated on the Contact record.\\n• Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.\\n\\nRequirements. Design Guidelines\\n\\nThe following design guidelines must be followed:\\n\\n• Schema changes must be made using the method requiring the least amount of storage to meet the requirement.\\n• Out-of-the-box functionality must be used when possible.\\n• Any code required to calculate scores must be able to be run from a single point.\\n• Email notifications need to be kept to a minimum.\\n\\n\\nIssues\\n-\\n\\n• Recruiters report that the command button to score a candidate is not working. You debug the code and observe that the context input parameter is null.\\n• The system does not support associating designations and certifications with candidates.\\n• The value for the field used by the PCF control to display local time is saved to Microsoft Dataverse each time an active application record is opened.\\n• Interviewers report that they do not receive email notifications when interview records are created for an existing person of interest.\n\n You need to configure the columns to store scores and totals.\\n\\nWhich configurations should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate configurations to the correct columns. Each configuration may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.\\n\\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.",
